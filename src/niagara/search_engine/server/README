The search engine server can handle requests from heterogeneous clients such as web cgi scripts, the stand-alone search engine GUI, and the Niagara Query Engine.

You can set up the search engine in two steps: building indexes & running server.

1. Index building

Before you construct indexes in the directory of your choice (say, idx),
make sure about two things:

1. Copy the indexMgr configuration file 'seindex.config' from 
   search_engine/indexmgr to the dir where you run the indexer.
   Alternatively, you can create a link to 'seindex.config' in the
   indexMgr directory.

2. Modify the options in seindex.config to specify where you want the
   *.IDX and inverted lists to be placed.

Now you can construct indexes by typing
  Javarun niagara.search_engine.server.ConstructIndex <url-list file>

<url-list file> is the file containing the urls that you want to index on.
Two examples of them are in this directory for your convenience, 'url_list'
and 'url_list.books'.  You can try to construct index using them.

If you are in a directory other than search_engine/server,please make sure your CLASSPATH is valid, then try 'java' instead of 'Javarun'. It applies to all following Javarun commands in this README.

Assume that you specified directory $SEIVL in which to put all the
indices, when the indexer is done, you will find some *IDX files together
with a few index directories under $SEIVL. They are used by the
indexmgr for managing its indexes.  If you want to index more urls
or files, you can do the above step on your own file of urls.  

2. Running SE server

After building indexes, you can run the search_engine server. Just make sure you are in the directory where you build the indexes (in our example, idx directory). Then run the following command:
  Javarun niagara.search_engine.server.SEServer

The communication port is set to 1710 by default.

After this, you can test it using the command-line client -- SEClient:
  Javarun niagara.search_engine.server.SEClient <host-name>

For more information about how to use the SEClient, try 'help' at the prompt.
