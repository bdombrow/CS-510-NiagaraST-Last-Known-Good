This directory contains specification for XML-QL parser and classes required
to represent them in memory. 

Parser for XML-Ql

  The parser for XML-QL takes the query and generates an in memory representation of it, also called parsed tree. This parsed tree can be traversed to generate query plan using the allowed operators. 

Generation of Parsed Tree

        |-- query
              |
              |-- List of Conditions (WHERE part)
	      |
              |-- result (CONSTRUCT Part)

                     Conditions
			  |
			  |-- type (InClause, IN or Predicate)
			  |
			  |-- pattern (for InClause)
			  |
			  |-- set (for list of urls in InClause or 
				of identifiers for IN)
			  |
			  |-- predicate (binary tree)
			  |
			  |-- data (for variable if IN, or dtd type if InClause)                          
    	                    
		     result (n-ary tree)
			  |
  			  |-- element ( either identifier or list of
                			result)
  			  |
  			  |-- var    

			pattern (n-ary tree)
			   |
			   |-- regular expression for start tag (binary tree)
			   |
			   |-- List of attribute (name-value pair)
			   |
			   |-- List of pattern
			   |
			   |-- data (if leaf)
			   |
			   |-- binding data (ELEMENT_AS/CONTENT_AS)



dump() method in all these classes helps in understanding (to some extent)
their structure. For more detail you can contact me (for a pizza ofcourse !!!)
